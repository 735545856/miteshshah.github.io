Mitesh is good at Shell Scripting and Linux System administration. He is capable of handling the whole team, There were around 10-15 developers, and he was able to help each one of them whenever required. He developed the "EasyEngine- CLI tool to manage WordPress and other PHP hosting" and handled all the support and other tasks related to it. He is really good at Server administration. I wish him best for his future endeavours. :)<br><br>

Mitesh`s shell scripting skills are really great and he is very good at it. He has always helped in fixing issues related to servers of large traffic websites. "EasyEngine" was developed from scratch by Mitesh single handedly and it has made the life of Wordpress developers very easy. +1 to Mitesh for this awesome creation :-)<br><br>
