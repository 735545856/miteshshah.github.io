* Some time we have to give temporary access to some Github users.
* It's little bit time consuming to ask users to provide their ssh-keys.

* Github has nice urls to fix this issue and we can directly find any Github users public keys.

**For Example:**

* Find My Public Keys at <a href="https://github.com/MiteshShah.keys">https://github.com/MiteshShah.keys</a>

**NOTE!**: You have to appends `.keys` after username to find that user public keys.
