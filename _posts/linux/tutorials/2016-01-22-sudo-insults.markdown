* An interesting sudo feature is the ability to insult you when you type a wrong password.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo visudo
# Find the line that begins with Default and add following line
Defaults 	insults
{% endhighlight %}

* It has really funny phrases, see some of them

{% highlight bash %}
Take a stress pill and think things over.
There must be cure for it!
Iâ€™ve seen penguins that can type better than that.
Maybe if you used more than just two fingers...
I think ... err ... I think ... I think I'll go home
{% endhighlight %}
